This library is a client implementation of the [Coinbase API](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud)s.

If you are looking for a library to interact with Coinbase Pro, we recommend [coinbase-pro-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/coinbase-pro-node). We **will not** be supporting Coinbase Pro in this library.

npm install @bytewaveco/coinbasejs
